# OpenCLI Usage Guide

> Make any website or Electron App your CLI. Reuse Chrome login, zero risk, AI-powered discovery.

## Install & Run

```bash
# npm global install (recommended)
npm install -g @jackwener/opencli
opencli <command>

# Or from source
cd ~/code/opencli && npm install
npx tsx src/main.ts <command>

# Update to latest
npm update -g @jackwener/opencli
```

## Prerequisites

Browser commands require:
1. Chrome browser running **(logged into target sites)**
2. **opencli Browser Bridge** Chrome extension installed (load `extension/` as unpacked in `chrome://extensions`)
3. No further setup needed — the daemon auto-starts on first browser command

> **Note**: You must be logged into the target website in Chrome before running commands. Tabs opened during command execution are auto-closed afterwards.

Public API commands (`hackernews`, `v2ex`) need no browser.
